# Assembly Analyst

This is a mod for the game [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com). It is published in zip-format on the Factorio [mod portal](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/assemblyanalyst), which allows it to be downloaded and updated in-game by the users/players.

It enables you to select certain parts of a factory for analysis, providing a breakdown of what all the assemblers, miners, labs, and inserters spend their time on. At a basic level, what [Bottleneck](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Bottleneck) does. What Assembly Analyst provides in addition is a more detailed view of the status of the machines, and more importantly, a history of the machines' status, so it's possible to see how much of the time a machine is not doing what it should.

The mod is optimized for performance, but it is still pretty performance-intensive. It's intended to be used to analyse local, newly built production lines, not to leave big analysis zones active permanently.

Suggestions and bug reports are centralized here on Github. Feel free to join the Factory Planner [Discord](https://discord.gg/ABqNEQc) to talk to me and others in a more casual way.

I'm happy to hear about any ideas you have. Issues are disabled for this repo because I'd like to centralize them on the [mod portal](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/assemblyanalyst/discussion) so non-technical users can participate more easily.
